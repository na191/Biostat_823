    "First, the possible outcomes for die rolls for Peter and Colin were calculated with intertools combinations_with_replacement since each integer has an equal probability of occuring with each roll. Once the outcomes were produced, the sum of each outcome was calculated using a for loop. Then, all of the different combinations of sums were produced using the product function. This function created a list of tuples, so this was changed to a list of lists to make manipulation easier. A list comprehension was used to filter the list of lists to those where peter had a higher sum. The count of the outcomes where peter won was divided by the total number of outcomes. This gave a probability of 0.5504525, after rounding to 7 decimal places. "

This is done because if the number is even, the step size can be 2 instead of one. This step size will capture all factor sets since they must contain even numbers. Next, a list of factors is created usin the reduce and .__add__ functions. This combination of functions loops through the numbers by the step size to find the factors. The range of elements was set from 1 to the square root of number since a square root times a square root will equal the original value, there is no reason to search larger numbers. If not num % i says that if there is not a remainder, the number is a factor [sources listed above].\n",
