    "First, the possible outcomes for die rolls for Peter and Colin were calculated with intertools combinations_with_replacement since each integer has an equal probability of occuring with each roll. Once the outcomes were produced, the sum of each outcome was calculated using a for loop. Then, all of the different combinations of sums were produced using the product function. This function created a list of tuples, so this was changed to a list of lists to make manipulation easier. A list comprehension was used to filter the list of lists to those where peter had a higher sum. The count of the outcomes where peter won was divided by the total number of outcomes. This gave us a probability of 0.5504525. "
